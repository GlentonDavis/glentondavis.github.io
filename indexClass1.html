      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        I’m originally from Montgomery, Alabama, but spent my adolescence in Watertown, Connecticut, at The Taft School, a New England boarding school. I then went to Yale University, where I was the musical director of The Yale Alley Cats and a first tenor in The Yale Whiffenpoofs. I graduated in 2007 with a degree in Economics. After college, I worked at J.P.Morgan for the Chief Investment Officer of the firm’s global Asset & Wealth Management division. I left in late 2009, however, to promote a pop album that I independently released in Canada which broke through the Top 400 albums in the country. Upon returning to the U.S. in late 2010, I founded a nonprofit organization that used pop music to teach middle and high-school students math. I’m now a first year in Northwestern’s joint JD-MBA program, and am excited to spend my summer working and learning with all of you.
